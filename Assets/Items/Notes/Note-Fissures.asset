  Description: 'The flames on the ancient pillars have mysteriously gone out. A fissure
    then appeared and some type of purple rain is rising out of them. It seems to
    be a manifestation of some kind of otherworldly energy. I think with enough <b><i>Agency</i></b>
    <sprite name="Agency">  you could interact with the pillars and light them again. '
