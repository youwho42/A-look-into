  Description: 'To whom it may concern,

    I have been stuck in this valley for
    years now. The folk from the nearest village are unable to stop the purple rain
    from blocking the way, and I don''t have the <b><i>Agency</i></b> to do it. Maybe
    someday someone will be able to fix these fissures everywhere.'
