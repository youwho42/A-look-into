  Name: How to farm
  AnimationName: 
  Description: To farm you need to have a functional farming area. If you put seeds
    in the seed box those seeds will be planted by a <sprite anim="0,1,12">. When
    the plants are fully grown another <sprite anim="0,1,12"> will harvest them and
    put them in the seed box (but you can also harvest it and get a bit more per
    plant). Only one type of crop can be planted in the same area at a time.
