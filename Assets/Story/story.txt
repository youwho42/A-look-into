Chaos - Maybe you could just start by being teleported into the world,
summoned by someone and you build up, survive, and maybe by building it up and completing certain things, 
things happen. Like someone sends you mysterious letters or something and gives you quests. 
Like you don't know why you're there, but you're doing these things for someone and over the course 
of the quests they give the player, they discover more about the mysterious person until 
you get to a point where they reveal themselves.


Blu - Slick dialogue:
		I sure slipped up on that one.

		Ich könnte etwas Hellar sein, nicht wahr?



		



drejali: 100th player!!!!


START YEAR: 505
Main Village Name: Thimbleton
Village berry: Thimbleberry


(ADDED)
    First NPC's, the mice drawn by Cryssball, named Ramiro and Manuela


	Gumption named by ChaosTails
		This is your ability to interact with NPC's. Each interaction diminishes you gumption,
		making you need to choose who and how many people you interact with. Naturally sitting, intentionally sitting 
		and observing animals give back gumption. Particle effect needed 

Ducks for dbeckerton944 one with a crown and occasionally lays a golden egg

		"A couple who've taken refuge on a hill close by have been greatly troubled by these strange occurrences, and they could use some help."
		"Would you be so kind as to lend a feathery hand? Boc."

TO DO:

	GENERAL THINGS I NEED TO DO:

		
		
		- teleports/fast travel should be "Zoop machines"
		

		- Gunther is something like st elmo's fire... figure it out.
		- lousenti - a very slow yet intriguingly attractive hedgehog. still observable with the spyglass but
			the first time you interact with it, it warns that the next interaction will result in a deleted save file 
			and close the the game application.
		- volmancer is an animal that has powerful wings that can generate gusts of wind, 
			and the ability to control the element of air in other ways,
			such as summoning lightning or creating clouds. aka weather!
			OR! it comes out only at 5:55AM to put out all the fires in the world 
			and also at 20:20 to light all the fires in the world.
		- some type of Clippy reference (a paranoid paperclip walking around aimlessly with nothing to hold together. 
			If you can corner it you can give it paper that you've crafted and complete its existence)
		
		- Pixel_3D_X: hide a small cat statue named "Kitka", tribute to my kitty :3

						
		 
		BALL PEOPLE UNDERTAKINGS:
			
			Ball people that want to see a few more things.
			
			A few ball people to give you guides and notes.
			
			The ball people village has objects you fix, for each one something worthwhile happens for the player 
				- spawn chest for a random item every day
				- 
				- 
			When everything is fixed the ball people have a little party every night in the village
			if the player attends it will generate something really good (but ephemeral) for the player eg: 10 platinum ingots, 100 dynamiblobs, etc...

BUGS!!!!!!!!!!

		Played your game, latest version got stuck here... https://imgur.com/MahzJjb
        Got stock in wall behind ramiros house

        
	
	

THINGS TO CHANGE
	
	- Add a seeder
	
	- Decoration items should have diminishing returns of Gumption for each similar item placed.

	

	- Options > L1 R1 don't change the menu?
	
	
	- add pulling crafting materials from nearby chests for crafting stations

	- add hold e to gather all surrounding items... 
			Press Q to open a container that has all the surrounding objects in a certain radius.
			
	- INDISCERNIBLE KLAXON (Loud and un-noticed)

				- Chicken peck animation as save / load icon... somewhere. 
					Difficult because everything comes to a standstill at both of these moments.

	- mice need to stop and smell flowers...



CHANGELOG:
		
					

COMMENTS
		
		
ACHIEVEMENTS: (https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/)
			Volmancer:	Haha, you gotta add a Motormouth achievement 
						for the first time the player exhausts gumption with NPCS XD

			Meneliki(modified):	If the player chops X amount of wood he/she gets an achievement called "Timberborn"
			Meneliki: Achievment unlocked: Learn your ABCs (first completion of the maze)

						- Kick a ball 30 units

						- The Six Labors - Complete the maze 6 times

						- Hyperventilate! breathe in and out (ten) times without hitting the max and without it emptying
						
						- Poke anything pokable 10 times in one day in one session.

GAME SUGGESTIONS:

			drgambit____:	make the sculpture a quest based endeavour, step by step throughout the quest the sculptures builds itself 
							little by little and at the end of quest you make it so that the sculpture essentially gives a buff to your character 
							by giving him some form of an aura, as a buff. As for the Sculpture design itself i would say make it some kind of 
							mythological cute animal haha... and the quest giver is an old turtle.

			each ball of the sculpture needs to be in the music algo.

			 Lunibs/Lousenti -	I think we also need a troll in the game. 
								For example a vendor offering the regular stuff and in addition something REALLY fancy. 
								The sword from Zelda or the whip from Castlevania. Something REALLY cool, however, 
								it always costs a little more than you currently have. After you visit the vendor 3 times, 
								the item is sold
