Maybe you could just start by being teleported into the world, summoned by someone and you build up, survive, and maybe by building it up and completing certain things, things happen. Like someone sends you mysterious letters or something and gives you quests. Like you don't know why you're there, but you're doing these things for someone and over the course of the quests they give the player, they discover more about the mysterious person until you get to a point where they reveal themselves.
