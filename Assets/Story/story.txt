TO DO:

		- Gunther is something like st elmo's fire... figure it out.
		- lousenti - a very slow yet intriguingly attractive hedgehog. still observable with the spyglass but
			the first time you interact with it, it warns that the next interaction will result in a deleted save file 
			and close the the game application.
		- volmancer is an animal that has powerful wings that can generate gusts of wind, 
			and the ability to control the element of air in other ways,
			such as summoning lightning or creating clouds. aka weather!
			OR! it comes out only at 5:55AM to put out all the fires in the world 
			and also at 20:20 to light all the fires in the world.
		- some type of Clippy reference (a paranoid paperclip walking around aimlessly with nothing to hold together.
