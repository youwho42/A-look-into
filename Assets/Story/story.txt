TO DO:

	GENERAL THINGS I NEED TO DO:

		- Redo the entire dialogue system.
		- Figure out localization

		

		- Gunther is something like st elmo's fire... figure it out.
		- lousenti - a very slow yet intriguingly attractive hedgehog. still observable with the spyglass but
			the first time you interact with it, it warns that the next interaction will result in a deleted save file 
			and close the the game application.
		- volmancer is an animal that has powerful wings that can generate gusts of wind, 
			and the ability to control the element of air in other ways,
			such as summoning lightning or creating clouds. aka weather!
			OR! it comes out only at 5:55AM to put out all the fires in the world 
			and also at 20:20 to light all the fires in the world.
		- some type of Clippy reference (a paranoid paperclip walking around aimlessly with nothing to hold together. 
			If you can corner it you can give it paper that you've crafted and complete its existence)
	
		 
		BALL PEOPLE UNDERTAKINGS:
			
			Ball people that want to see a few more things.
			
			A few ball people to give you guides and notes.
			

		ITEMS TO ADD:

			CRAFTABLES:

				- spinner => fiber -> twine -> rope / flax fiber -> thread
				- loom => thread -> cloth
				- potted plants
				- torches
				- 
			
			FINDABLES:

		RECIPES FROM ANIMALS:

BALL PEOPLE:
	- Each one is found somewhere in the world or spawns when needed. 
	- Each one has a specific desire:
		- Traveler - bring to location
		- Seeker - want to see an item or crafted object 
			=> BluePinStudios - one "wants to lick sticks. as soon as he steps on one, its considered licked"
		- Messenger - has a message/undertaking for you 
		
		etc...


	Need menu to view each ones desire?




BUGS!!!!!!!!!!
	- when the squirrel apears on the screen it doesn't get the right animation (idle while running)
	- bluebell butterflies appears on the screen it is the wrong animation... (flying while idle)
	 


THINGS TO CHANGE
	
	- UI on ultrawide screens is broken.
	- add disable auto-zoom-out to video options



CHANGELOG:
		- fixed: exiting sleep menu blocked entering other menus.
		- small inhabitants: appearing sound effect is now on the visual effect iteself, not the general sounds effects.
		- notifications: now showing how many items were picked up, not the total amount in your inventory.
