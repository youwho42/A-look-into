Chaos - Maybe you could just start by being teleported into the world,
summoned by someone and you build up, survive, and maybe by building it up and completing certain things, 
things happen. Like someone sends you mysterious letters or something and gives you quests. 
Like you don't know why you're there, but you're doing these things for someone and over the course 
of the quests they give the player, they discover more about the mysterious person until 
you get to a point where they reveal themselves.


Blu - Slick dialogue:
		I sure slipped up on that one.

		Ich könnte etwas Hellar sein, nicht wahr?



(ADDED)
    First NPC's, the mice drawn by Cryssball, named Ramiro and Manuela


	Gumption named by ChaosTails
		This is your ability to interact with NPC's. Each interaction diminishes you gumption,
		making you need to choose who and how many people you interact with. Naturally sitting, intentionally sitting 
		and observing animals give back gumption. Particle effect needed

TO DO:

	GENERAL THINGS I NEED TO DO:

		
		
		- teleports/fast travel should be "Zoop machines"
		

		- Gunther is something like st elmo's fire... figure it out.
		- lousenti - a very slow yet intriguingly attractive hedgehog. still observable with the spyglass but
			the first time you interact with it, it warns that the next interaction will result in a deleted save file 
			and close the the game application.
		- volmancer is an animal that has powerful wings that can generate gusts of wind, 
			and the ability to control the element of air in other ways,
			such as summoning lightning or creating clouds. aka weather!
			OR! it comes out only at 5:55AM to put out all the fires in the world 
			and also at 20:20 to light all the fires in the world.
		- some type of Clippy reference (a paranoid paperclip walking around aimlessly with nothing to hold together. 
			If you can corner it you can give it paper that you've crafted and complete its existence)
		
						
		 
		BALL PEOPLE UNDERTAKINGS:
			
			Ball people that want to see a few more things.
			
			A few ball people to give you guides and notes.
			
			The ball people village has objects you fix, for each one something worthwhile happens for the player 
				- spawn chest for a random item every day
				- 
				- 
			When everything is fixed the ball people have a little party every night in the village
			if the player attends it will generate something really good (but ephemeral) for the player eg: 10 platinum ingots, 100 dynamiblobs, etc...

BUGS!!!!!!!!!!

	
	

	

THINGS TO CHANGE

	
	
	
	

	- Why no interest in the camp area??!??

	- Visual tutorial for crafting and research (arrows in a certain order).

				- maybe add pulsing intensity going from furtherst player location towards current player location
				- Maybe add to legend player trail color.

	

	- add pulling crafting materials from nearby chests for crafting stations

	- add hold e to gather all surrounding items... 
			Press Q to open a container that has all the surrounding objects in a certain radius.

					
	- INDISCERNIBLE KLAXON (Loud and un-noticed)

	- Chicken peck animation as save icon... somewhere.


	


        
        
        

        * BUG - Still an issue - Stone axe recipes filling up workstations recipe list - photo Still an issue
            OUTPUT shown below crafting station at this point, saving at this point ruins/removes the save file from showing up in load (the aliv files exists in file system)
        

        * SUGGESTION -  maybe have agency as an item in the compendium that describes more what it is and how to aquire it 





CHANGELOG:

	


COMMENTS
		
		
ACHIEVEMENTS: (https://wiki.facepunch.com/steamworks/)
			Volmancer:	Haha, you gotta add a Motormouth achievement 
						for the first time the player exhausts gumption with NPCS XD

			Meneliki(modified):	If the player chops X amount of wood he/she gets an achievement called "Timberborn"
			Meneliki: Achievment unlocked: Learn your ABCs (first completion of the maze)

						- Kick a ball 100 units

						- The Six Labors - Complete the maze 6 times
