Hello IndieMania! I am the official spoke-being for Julian Thompson.

Artist turned game developer, he started working on his game A look into... a few years ago. 
It started out as a desire to create an isometric tileset, and turned in to his biggest art project ever.
He is very proud of it and loves working on it every chance he gets.
Each day brings a new and interesting challenge, making the game prettier, cuter, and more detailed and complex than before.
He's developed the game solo, and did so entirely while streaming on Twitch with a loving and caring community of followers,
making them listen to strange music along the way.
It might be a few more years before the game is finished,
but rest assured that when it's done it will be the best thing since arrow hats.



As for A look into... it's a serene and open-ended game designed to immerse you in a peaceful world that could be a living painting.
Explore a diverse and beautiful ecosystem, discovering mysteries, secrets and many other wonders. 
Engage in minigames to observe the surrounding wild-life and for gathering wood and ore. 
Collect materials and research items to unlock new recipes and capabilities. 
Craft tools and workstations to aid you in your tasks. 
Farm, cook foods, and decorate your surroundings.
And throughout it all, take pride in helping the communities you encounter. 
And don't forget to stop and smell the flowers along the way!
