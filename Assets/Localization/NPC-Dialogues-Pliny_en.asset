      almost had it all figured out, and then, out of no where mind you, the most
      incredible thing happened, these piles of junk piled up and we were block over
      here on the other side of the river and haven''t been able to leave since you
      got here. '

    m_Localized: Hahahahaha! Good one. I had a friend in the day that would always
      tease me about it. She always remarked that I talk too much, and she just wouldn't
      shut up about it. Of course she said that she only mentioned it the once, but
      I recall it as if it was yesterday, it was a non-stop flow of telling me I
      talk too much. Me! Can you imagine?!

    m_Localized: Well, it was nice meeting you. I really have to go now. I mean,
      you popped into our little world and now I'm going to have to reajust my daily
      activities I guess. I'll have to figure that out. I'm not blaming you for anything,
      but yeah, this is gonna disturb all kinds of habits. Not just for me either.
