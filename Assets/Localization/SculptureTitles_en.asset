    m_Localized: Myrna is the great founder of the village. Her courange and determination
      is an inspiration to all who hear her story. She was defiant in the face of
      her adversaries and detractors, and that Cokernut Flump never stood a chance
      against such a being. We can all be grateful that she was a benevolent soul,
      for we would have plunged back into the days of yore when Cokernut ruled and
      whined.

    m_Localized: You'd never suspect that this animal is as useful as it is in the
      world. It keeps its items in every place it is found, wherever it might go.
      Always prepared, always ready, forever fluffy.
