    m_Localized: "Thank you for showing an interest in my project! Please start a
      new save for this update.\nThis is mainly an art project that I have worked
      on for many years, and will continue to work on for many years to come. I work
      on it as much as I can as a solo dev, with the incredible help and support
      of my followers on Twitch.\nThe game itself is starting to come in to its own.
      There have been many cute and exciting additions lately, making it an even
      greater joy to work on! \nI would love some feedback on either <link=\"https://twitch.tv/klaxon42\"><b>twitch.tv/klaxon42</b></link>,
      or on the discord server at <link=\"https://discord.gg/89wFG3S\"><b>discord.gg/89wFG3S</b></link>.\nI
      hope you enjoy what is there so far!"
